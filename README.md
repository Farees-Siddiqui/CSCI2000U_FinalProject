# CSCI2000U_FinalProject
This repo contains our final project for the second year class `Scientific Data Analysis`. The project we chose to make is a program to figure out whether or not an individual is at risk of having a heart attack or any other cardiac incident. We used Exploratory Data Analysis to figure out the important risk factors for someone exhibiting cardiac symptoms.
